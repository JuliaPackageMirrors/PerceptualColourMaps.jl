The Perceptual Colour Maps package provides functions for creating
high quality colour maps that have consistent perceptual contrast over
their full range.
 
The key observation is that at fine spatial frequencies perceptual
contrast is dominated by *lightness* difference, chroma and hue are
relatively unimportant.
